In this project, with the help of my peers, I examined a manufacturing company's supply chain dataset that compiles historical information about orders, plants, ports, and associated transportation costs. We aimed to optimize overall transportation costs while considering constraints related to specific production facilities for certain products, exclusive connections between ports and production plants, as well as vendor-managed inventory (VMI) agreements and warehouse capacity limitations. Using Python, we developed a model that incorporates these supply chain constraints and determines the optimal plant and port for each order type.
